        <p>
            A way to eat yogurt with one hand! These bars have a subtle sweetness and are rather filling thanks to the almond butter, oats, and yogurt.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Soft Medjool Dates (pits removed)</li>
            <li>2 cups Old-Fashioned Rolled Oats</li>
            <li>1 cup Almond Butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Ground Flaxseeds</li>
            <li>1 tsp Ground Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Unsweetened Soy Yogurt</li>
            <li>1 cup Stewed Berries</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <li>In a food processor, blend the dates until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the oats, almond butter, ground flaxseed, and cinnamon. Blend again until well combined, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed.</li>
            <li>Transfer the mix to an 11 x 7 inch parchment-lined baking dish and press firmly into the base of the dish.</li>
            <li>Top with the yogurt and spread out evenly.</li>
            <li>Dot the yogurt with the stewed berries and use a butter knife to swirl.</li>
            <li>Place into the freezer and let freeze for 1-2 hours, or until the bars are solid enough to cut.</li>
            <li>When removed from the freezer, cut into squares or bars of the desired size.</li>
            <li>Let thaw for 3-5 minutes before eating.</li>
        </ol>
